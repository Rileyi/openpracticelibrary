## What is it?

The copy & paste practice allows you to write a lot with only two combinations of keys.

## Why use an Agile Agenda?

* Sessions like [event storming](/practices/event-storming/) or [user story mapping](/practices/user-story-mapping/) don't neatly fit into time boxes. As such, you'll need to dynamic with the way you manage the agenda.
* Whiteboards and stickies are easier to change than digital agendas which might need some formatting or even have access issues.
* It works as an Information Radiator[<sup>1</sup>](#footnote-1) throughout the workshop, making it a logical area to gather the team to review the agenda as well as do time checks. Compare this to an agenda captured in a slide deck, which doesn't naturally lead to a team huddle.

* Collaborative Face Drawing[<sup>2</sup>](#footnote-2) is a great ice breaker or after lunch activity. Your agile agenda can be a nice home for the faces once the activity is over as seen below:
